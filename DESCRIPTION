Description: Conditioned Latin hypercube sampling, as published by Minasny and McBratney (2006) <DOI:10.1016/j.cageo.2005.12.009>. This method proposes to stratify sampling in presence of ancillary data. An extension of this method, which propose to associate a cost to each individual and take it into account during the optimisation process, is also proposed (Roudier et al., 2012, <DOI:10.1201/b12728-46>).
